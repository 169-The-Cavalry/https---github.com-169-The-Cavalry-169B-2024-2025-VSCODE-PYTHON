# VEXcode Robot Configuration and Control

This project contains the robot configuration and control routines for a VEX V5 competition robot. The code is written in Python using the VEXcode API and is designed to handle both autonomous and driver-control modes. It integrates hardware initialization, event handling, and multi-threaded tasks to manage the robot’s various functions.

## Overview

This code sets up a VEX V5 robot by initializing its motors, sensors, and controllers. It provides routines for:
- **Autonomous mode:** Includes an autonomous selector and PID-based control functions for turning and moving a specified distance.
- **Driver control mode:** Manages manual control tasks, such as driving, operating the intake, and controlling auxiliary mechanisms like a clamp or a “Lady Brown” mechanism.

The code uses global variables to share state across different functions and relies on multi-threading to run several control tasks concurrently.

## Hardware Configuration

The robot is configured with the following components:

- **Brain:**  
  - Default instance is created (`brain = Brain()`).

- **Controller:**  
  - A primary controller is configured (`controller_1 = Controller(PRIMARY)`).

- **Motors:**  
  - **Right Motors:**  
    - Motor on Port 1  
    - Motor on Port 2  
    - Combined as a `MotorGroup` (`RightMotors`)
  - **Left Motors:**  
    - Motor on Port 12  
    - Motor on Port 13  
    - Combined as a `MotorGroup` (`LeftMotors`)
  - **Front Motors:**  
    - Right Front Motor on Port 9  
    - Left Front Motor on Port 19
  - **Lady Brown Mechanism:**  
    - Motor on Port 20 (inverted)  
    - Motor on Port 10  
    - Combined as a `MotorGroup` (`Lady_Brown`)
  - **Intake:**  
    - Motor on Port 8

- **Sensors:**  
  - **Inertial Sensor:** on Port 5  
  - **Optical Sensor:** on Port 4  
  - **GPS Sensor:** on Port 3  
  - **Distance Sensor:** on Port 11  
  - **Rotation Sensor:** on Port 15

- **Digital Outputs:**  
  - Configured on three-wire ports (`digital_out_b`, `digital_out_g`, and `digital_out_e`).

A short delay is added after initializing the rotation sensor to ensure proper calibration.

## Software Components

The project is organized into several key sections:

1. **Robot Configuration (Region Block):**  
   - Initializes all motors, sensors, and the controller.
   - Sets up digital outputs and sensor parameters.

2. **Event Handlers:**  
   - Functions to process controller events:
     - `onevent_controller_1axis2Changed_0` and `onevent_controller_1axis3Changed_0` adjust joystick values using a dead zone.
     - `onevent_controller_1buttonL1_pressed_0` cycles through autonomous routines on the controller screen.
   - Additional event handlers are used for tasks such as clamp control and sweeping mechanisms.

3. **Driver Control Functions:**  
   - `ondriver_drivercontrol_0` handles intake control.
   - `ondriver_drivercontrol_1` manages motor velocity control for driving.
   - `ondriver_drivercontrol_2` and `ondriver_drivercontrol_3` manage clamp and sweeper controls, respectively.
   - `ondriver_drivercontrol_4` provides control for the Lady Brown mechanism using dedicated buttons.

4. **Autonomous Mode Functions:**  
   - `onauton_autonomous_0` is the main autonomous routine.
   - It calibrates the inertial sensor and uses a PID-based routine for turning and distance control.
   - PID functions like `Forward_PID_Distance_Max_Speed` are defined for precise movement.

5. **Initialization and Calibration:**  
   - Functions such as `when_started4`, `when_started2`, and `when_started3` set up sensors (e.g., optical sensor settings) and prepare the robot for operation.
   - The function `onevent_stop_initialize_0` sets motor stopping types and initializes motor velocities.

6. **Competition Integration:**  
   - The `Competition` class is used to register autonomous and driver control functions.
   - The main competition tasks (`vexcode_auton_function` and `vexcode_driver_function`) launch separate threads to handle robot control during competition periods.

---

## Competition Modes

- **Autonomous Mode:**  
  - When the competition enters autonomous mode, the `vexcode_auton_function()` is called.
  - This function creates a thread for `onauton_autonomous_0` and then waits until the autonomous period ends.
  - Autonomous routines include sensor calibration, movement control, and PID-based adjustments.

- **Driver Control Mode:**  
  - In driver control mode, the `vexcode_driver_function()` creates separate threads for each driver control routine.
  - These routines handle live input from the controller to manage driving, intake, and other mechanisms.
  - The function continuously checks the competition state and stops the tasks when driver control ends.

## Usage Instructions

1. **Deployment:**
   - Open the code in VEXcode Pro V5.
   - Ensure that the physical robot’s hardware (motors, sensors, and ports) matches the configuration in the code.
   - Download and deploy the code to the VEX V5 Brain.

2. **During Competition:**
   - The competition template automatically calls the registered functions based on the competition state.
   - Autonomous and driver control routines will run concurrently, managing sensor input and motor control.

3. **Debugging and Testing:**
   - Use the controller screen and console prints (e.g., via `print()` statements) for debugging.
   - Adjust PID constants and dead zone ranges as needed for optimal performance.

## Customization and Extensions

- **PID Tuning:**  
  - The PID control parameters (`Kp`, `Ki`, `Kd`, and `Dellay`) in the `Forward_PID_Distance_Max_Speed` function can be tuned for different movement characteristics.

- **Autonomous Selector:**  
  - The function `when_started5` displays different autonomous routine options on the controller screen.
  - Modify the messages and logic to suit your team’s strategy.

- **Additional Modules:**  
  - Several import statements are commented out (e.g., from `MAIN_GB.main1` or `INIT.init`). These can be integrated if additional project modules are available.

- **Global State Variables:**  
  - The code uses many global variables to manage state across functions. Exercise care when modifying these to avoid unintended side effects.

---

## Dependencies

- **VEXcode V5 Python Libraries:**  
  - The code is built on the VEX robotics Python API (the `vex` module).
- **Standard Python Libraries:**  
  - `urandom` (for seeding random numbers; its usage is currently commented out).

Ensure your VEXcode environment is set up with the necessary libraries to compile and run the code.

---

## Notes

- **Build and Compile:**  
  - Several functions include debug compile statements to help track the robot’s status.
- **Thread Management:**  
  - The project uses threads to run multiple tasks concurrently. Make sure any changes maintain proper synchronization.
- **Port Configurations:**  
  - Verify that the motor and sensor port assignments match your robot’s wiring.
